This week I got a issue about the error message would not show in the main project, but show in the project that was imported.
We didn't find the core result yet. Then, I discussed with my colleague. We thought that the reason may be the error tracker, Sentry that was installed in the main project.
It caught the error so that the error would not show in the main project.
