### About Me

Hi, I'm William. I'm a web developer who wants to make his life awesome through programming. I also love do something about maintaining mental health, such as photography, reading. The avatar is one of my favorite works, which I blent two images together to make multiple exposure effect.<br><br>
The folder called diary is the record about what impressed me on work.
